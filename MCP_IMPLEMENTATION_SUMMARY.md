# AIxplosion - MCP Support Implementation

## Summary

I have successfully added comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) support to your AIxplosion tool. This implementation includes both local stdio server support and remote WebSocket server support, with full management capabilities through interactive commands.

## What Was Added

### 1. New Dependencies
- `tokio-tungstenite = "0.20"` - For WebSocket connections
- Updated Cargo.toml to support MCP functionality

### 2. New Module: `src/mcp.rs`
A complete MCP implementation including:
- **McpManager**: Manages server connections, configuration, and tool discovery
- **McpConnection**: Handles individual server connections (stdio and WebSocket)
- **Protocol Support**: Full JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation for MCP communication
- **Configuration Management**: TOML-based server configuration

### 3. Enhanced Tool System (`src/tools.rs`)
- Added MCP tool integration with `create_mcp_tool()` function
- MCP tools are automatically prefixed with `mcp_<server>_<toolname>`
- Real-time tool refresh capabilities

### 4. Updated Agent (`src/agent.rs`)
- Integrated MCP manager into the agent
- Automatic tool refresh before message processing
- Seamless integration of MCP tools with existing tool ecosystem

### 5. Enhanced CLI (`src/main.rs`)
- New `/mcp` command with comprehensive subcommands
- Interactive server management
- Real-time connection status and tool listing
- Updated help system to include MCP commands

## Key Features

### Server Management
```bash
/mcp list                    # List all servers and their status
/mcp add <name> stdio <cmd>  # Add stdio server
/mcp add <name> ws <url>     # Add WebSocket server
/mcp connect <name>          # Connect to specific server
/mcp disconnect <name>       # Disconnect from server
/mcp reconnect <name>        # Reconnect to server
/mcp remove <name>           # Remove server configuration
/mcp connect-all             # Connect to all enabled servers
/mcp disconnect-all          # Disconnect from all servers
/mcp tools                   # List all available MCP tools
```

### Connection Types
1. **Stdio Servers**: Connect via standard input/output (for local tools)
2. **WebSocket Servers**: Connect via WebSocket (for remote services)

### Configuration
- Servers configured in `~/.config/aixplosion/mcp.toml`
- Persistent configuration across sessions
- Enable/disable servers as needed

### Tool Integration
- Automatic tool discovery from connected servers
- Tools appear as normal tools to the AIxplosion
- Real-time updates when servers connect/disconnect
- Error handling for failed tool calls

## Example Usage

### Adding a Filesystem Server
```bash
# Add the MCP filesystem server
/mcp add filesystem stdio npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /home/user/documents

# Connect to it
/mcp connect filesystem

# Use it
"List the files in the documents directory and show me the README file content"
```

### Adding a WebSocket Server
```bash
# Add a WebSocket-based MCP server
/mcp add apidata ws://api-server.example.com/mcp

# Connect and use
/mcp connect apidata
"Fetch the latest user data from the API"
```

## Configuration Example

```toml
[servers.filesystem]
name = "filesystem"
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/user/documents"]
enabled = true

[servers.database]
name = "database"
command = "python"
args = ["db_server.py", "--connection-string", "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db"]
env = { "DB_PASSWORD" = "secret" }
enabled = true

[servers.websocket_api]
name = "websocket_api"
url = "ws://api.example.com/mcp"
enabled = false
```

## Architecture

### Components
1. **McpManager**: Central management of all MCP connections
2. **McpConnection**: Individual server connection handling
3. **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with existing tool system
4. **Configuration Layer**: Persistent server configuration

### Flow
1. Agent starts â†’ MCP manager loads configuration
2. Auto-connect to enabled servers
3. Discover and integrate tools from connected servers
4. Tools available for use in AI conversations
5. Real-time updates when servers change

## Error Handling

- Connection failures don't crash the agent
- Tool execution errors are properly reported
- Server disconnections are handled gracefully
- Invalid configurations are safely ignored

## Security Considerations

- Only connect to trusted MCP servers
- Stdio servers execute commands - ensure they're safe
- WebSocket servers connect to remote endpoints
- Tool permissions should be considered

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling and logging. You can test the functionality by:

1. Building the project: `cargo build`
2. Running: `cargo run`
3. Using `/mcp` commands to manage servers
4. Adding test servers to verify functionality

## Future Enhancements

This implementation provides a solid foundation for MCP support. Future enhancements could include:

- Authentication for secure servers
- Load balancing across multiple server instances
- Tool result caching for performance
- Server health monitoring
- Advanced permission management

The MCP support is now fully integrated and ready for use with both local and external MCP servers!
