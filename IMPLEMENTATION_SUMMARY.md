# Context Files Implementation Summary

## What was implemented:

### 1. CLI Argument Enhancement
- Added `-f/--file` option to specify context files
- Supports multiple files: `-f file1.md -f file2.txt`

### 2. Agent Context Support
- Added `add_context_file()` method to `Agent` struct
- Context files are added to conversation before user messages
- Files are formatted as context messages with proper formatting

### 3. Automatic AGENTS.md Inclusion
- Automatically detects and includes `AGENTS.md` if it exists
- Works even when no explicit context files are specified

### 4. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing or unreadable files
- Error messages are displayed but don't crash the application
- Agent continues processing even with context file errors

### 5. Documentation and Testing
- Created comprehensive documentation
- Added test cases and examples
- Updated help information

## Code Changes:

### src/main.rs
- Added `context_files: Vec<String>` to CLI struct
- Added `add_context_files()` function
- Integrated context file loading into main flow
- Updated help text to include context file information

### src/agent.rs
- Added `add_context_file()` method
- Added necessary imports for file operations
- Context files are processed and added to conversation

## Usage Examples:

```bash
# Single context file
ai-agent -f README.md -m "Explain this project"

# Multiple context files
ai-agent -f README.md -f Cargo.toml -m "Describe the setup"

# Automatic AGENTS.md inclusion
ai-agent -m "What agents are available?"

# Interactive mode with context
ai-agent -f docs/api.md
```

## Benefits:
- Provides AI with relevant background information
- Reduces repetitive explanations
- Enables more contextually accurate responses
- Supports project documentation and configuration files
