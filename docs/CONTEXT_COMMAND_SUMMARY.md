# Context Display Command Testing

## Implementation Summary

I've successfully added a `/context` command to your AIxplosion that displays the current conversation context. Here's what was implemented:

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added `display_context()` method to `Agent` struct
- Located in `src/agent.rs`
- Shows detailed information about the conversation context
- Displays message roles, content types, and previews
- Shows tool calls, tool results, and text content
- Provides a summary of total messages and content blocks

#### 2. Updated slash command handler in `src/main.rs`
- Added `/context` command handling
- Updated help text to include the new command
- Maintains consistency with existing command structure

#### 3. Added necessary imports
- Added `colored::*` import to `src/agent.rs` for colored output

### Features of the `/context` Command

- **Message Overview**: Shows message number, role (user/assistant), and content block count
- **Content Preview**: Displays first 100 characters of text content
- **Tool Information**: Shows tool calls with names, IDs, and input parameters
- **Tool Results**: Displays tool execution results with character counts
- **Error Indication**: Highlights tool errors in red
- **Summary Statistics**: Shows total messages and content blocks
- **Empty State**: Provides helpful message when no context exists

### Usage

```bash
# Start interactive mode
aixplosion

# Use the /context command
> /context

# Or get help to see all commands
> /help
```

### Example Output

```
📝 Current Conversation Context
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

[1] USER: (1 content blocks)
  └─ Block 1: Text: Context from file 'AGENTS.md': # AIxplosions Documentation This file contains...

[2] ASSISTANT: (1 content blocks)
  └─ Block 1: Text: I can see you have an AIxplosions documentation file. This appears to be...

──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Summary: 2 messages, 2 total content blocks
```

### Benefits

- **Debugging**: Helps understand what the AI knows about the conversation
- **Context Awareness**: See which files have been loaded and what information is available
- **Tool Tracking**: Monitor which tools have been called and their results
- **Conversation Management**: Understand the state of the current conversation

The implementation is fully integrated and ready to use!
