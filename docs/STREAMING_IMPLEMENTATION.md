# Streaming Support Implementation

## Overview

Added streaming support for LLM responses to provide real-time feedback as responses are generated.

## Changes Made

### Dependencies (Cargo.toml)
- Added `futures-util = "0.3"` for stream processing
- Added `tokio-stream = "0.1"` for async stream support

### Anthropic Client (src/anthropic.rs)
- Added `StreamEvent` struct for parsing streaming events
- Added `create_message_stream()` method for streaming API calls
- Added `try_endpoint_stream()` helper method for handling streaming endpoints
- Processes Server-Sent Events (SSE) format from Anthropic API
- Accumulates content blocks and usage information during streaming

### Agent (src/agent.rs)
- Added `process_message_with_stream()` method with optional content callback
- Modified `process_message()` to use streaming method with no callback
- Handles both streaming and non-streaming modes seamlessly

### CLI (src/main.rs)
- Added `--stream` flag to enable streaming responses
- Updated help text to include streaming information
- Modified all modes (single message, non-interactive, interactive) to support streaming
- Streaming mode prints content as it arrives without spinner
- Non-streaming mode uses spinner and formats complete response

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Enable streaming for single message
aixplosion --stream -m "Tell me a story"

# Enable streaming for stdin
echo "Explain quantum computing" | aixplosion --stream --non-interactive

# Enable streaming in interactive mode
aixplosion --stream

# Regular non-streaming (default)
aixplosion -m "What's the weather like?"
```

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Feedback**: Users see responses as they're generated
2. **Reduced Perceived Latency**: No waiting for complete response
3. **Better UX**: Immediate visual feedback that the system is working
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality unchanged
5. **Flexible**: Can be enabled per-request via command line flag

## Technical Details

- Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) format from Anthropic API
- Processes content_block_delta events for real-time text
- Accumulates complete response for conversation history
- Maintains token usage tracking for streaming responses
- Handles both text and tool use content blocks
- Graceful fallback to non-streaming if streaming fails
