# Shell Commands (!) Feature Implementation

## Summary

I have successfully implemented the `!` command functionality for the AIxplosion. This feature allows users to execute shell commands directly in interactive mode by prefixing them with `!`.

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes Made

1. **main.rs**: Added `handle_shell_command()` function
   - Parses shell commands by removing the `!` prefix
   - Creates tool calls for the bash command
   - Executes commands through the existing security system
   - Handles command output and errors

2. **main.rs**: Updated interactive mode loop
   - Added check for `!` commands before processing AI messages
   - Integrated shell command handling with existing slash commands

3. **agent.rs**: Added `execute_bash_tool()` method
   - Provides direct access to bash tool execution
   - Maintains security permissions and logging
   - Handles background saving of updated permissions

4. **AGENTS.md**: Updated documentation
   - Added shell commands section with examples
   - Documented security implications
   - Updated usage examples and help text

### Key Features

✅ **Direct Shell Execution**: Commands like `!dir`, `!ls -la`, `!git status` work directly
✅ **Security Integration**: Uses existing bash tool security permissions
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows (cmd.exe) and Unix/Linux/macOS (bash)
✅ **Error Handling**: Shows command failures with clear error messages
✅ **Permission Management**: Unknown commands can ask for permission
✅ **Logging**: All executions are logged for security
✅ **Documentation**: Complete help and examples updated

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Start interactive mode
aixplosion

# Execute shell commands directly
> !dir                    # List directory (Windows)
> !ls -la                 # List files (Unix)
> !git status             # Check git status
> !cargo build            # Build project
> !echo "Hello World!"    # Print message
> !pwd                    # Show current directory
```

### Security Features

- Commands are subject to the same security permissions as the bash tool
- Use `/permissions allow <command>` to pre-approve commands
- Use `/permissions deny <command>` to block dangerous commands
- Unknown commands will ask for permission if security is enabled
- All shell command executions are logged

### Testing

- Code compiles successfully with `cargo check`
- Added test module for shell command functionality
- Integration with existing security system verified
- Cross-platform command execution supported

## Integration

The `!` command feature is fully integrated with existing functionality:
- Works alongside all existing slash commands (`/help`, `/stats`, etc.)
- Maintains conversation context and history
- Supports streaming and non-streaming modes
- Compatible with MCP tools and other agent features

## Benefits

1. **Faster Workflow**: No need to ask AI to execute simple shell commands
2. **Direct Control**: Users can execute commands exactly as intended
3. **Security Maintained**: All existing security controls apply
4. **Consistent Experience**: Same output format as bash tool execution
5. **Documentation**: Complete help and examples provided

The implementation follows all best practices for security, performance, and maintainability.
