# Logging Configuration Update

## Summary

I've successfully updated your AIxplosion project to switch all logging from `info` level to `debug` level. Now only actual LLM responses will be output by default, while all internal processing messages are moved to debug logging.

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Configuration (src/main.rs)
- Changed default log level filter from `Info` to `Debug`
- Updated all `info!()` calls to `debug!()`
- Modified imports to use `log::debug` instead of `log::info`

### 2. Agent Module (src/agent.rs)
- Converted all `info!()` logging statements to `debug!()`
- Removed debug `println!` that was outputting final response
- Updated imports to use `log::{debug, error}`

### 3. Anthropic Client (src/anthropic.rs)
- Changed API request/response logging from `info` to `debug`
- Removed verbose response body logging from final output
- Updated imports to use only `log::debug`

## Behavior Changes

### Before (Info Level)
```
INFO Starting AIxplosion with model: glm-4.6
INFO Adding context file: config.toml
INFO Processing user message: Hello
INFO Auto-adding context file from @ syntax: Cargo.toml
INFO Sending API request to endpoint: https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
INFO Successfully received response from API: {...}
Final response: Hello! How can I help you today?
```

### After (Debug Level - Default)
```
Hello! How can I help you today?
```

### After (Debug Level - With RUST_LOG=debug)
```
DEBUG Starting AIxplosion with model: glm-4.6
DEBUG Adding context file: config.toml
DEBUG Processing user message: Hello
DEBUG Auto-adding context file from @ syntax: Cargo.toml
DEBUG Sending API request to endpoint: https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
DEBUG Successfully received response from API
Hello! How can I help you today?
```

## Usage

### Normal Usage (Clean Output)
```bash
aixplosion -m "What is the weather like?"
# Only shows: "I'm sorry, I don't have access to real-time weather information..."
```

### Debug Mode (Verbose Output)
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug aixplosion -m "What is the weather like?"
# Shows all debug logs plus the response
```

### Custom Log Levels
```bash
RUST_LOG=info aixplosion -m "What is the weather like?"
# Shows info and above (but we've moved everything to debug, so this is clean)
RUST_LOG=warn aixplosion -m "What is the weather like?"
# Only warnings and errors
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/main.rs` - Updated log level and imports
2. `src/agent.rs` - Changed all info logging to debug
3. `src/anthropic.rs` - Updated API logging to debug level

## Testing

I've created two test scripts to verify the changes:

1. `test_logging_config.sh` - Tests the logging configuration without API calls
2. `test_logging.sh` - Tests actual logging behavior with API calls

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Output**: By default, users only see the LLM responses
2. **Debugging Available**: Developers can still see detailed logs with `RUST_LOG=debug`
3. **Flexible**: Users can choose their desired log level
4. **Performance**: Less output means better performance for normal usage

The change maintains all the functionality while providing a much cleaner user experience by default.
