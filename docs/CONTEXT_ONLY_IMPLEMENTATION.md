# Context-Only Mode Implementation

## Summary

I've successfully implemented the context-only mode feature as requested. Now when you send a message containing only `@file` references, the system will:

1. ✅ Add the specified files to the conversation context
2. ✅ Show success/error messages for each file
3. ✅ **NOT** make an API call to the AI
4. ✅ **NOT** print any response
5. ✅ Be ready for the next input

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `src/agent.rs`

**Key change in `process_message()` method:**
- Added early return when message contains only `@file` references
- Returns empty string instead of making API call
- Preserves all existing file loading logic

```rust
// If message is empty after cleaning (only contained @file references), 
// return early without making an API call
if cleaned_message.trim().is_empty() {
    info!("Message only contained @file references, not making API call");
    return Ok("".to_string());
}
```

### 2. Modified `src/main.rs`

**Updated interactive mode handling:**
- Added check for empty response before printing
- Only formats and prints non-empty responses
- Updated help text to document the new behavior

```rust
// Only print response if it's not empty (i.e., not just @file references)
if !response.is_empty() {
    formatter.print_formatted(&response)?;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Context-Only Messages (No API Call)

```bash
# Single file
aixplosion "@Cargo.toml"
# Output: ✓ Added context file: Cargo.toml

# Multiple files  
aixplosion "@src/main.rs @src/lib.rs @README.md"
# Output: ✓ Added context file: src/main.rs
#         ✓ Added context file: src/lib.rs  
#         ✓ Added context file: README.md

# Invalid file
aixplosion "@nonexistent.txt"
# Output: ✗ Failed to add context file 'nonexistent.txt': [error message]
```

### Messages with Questions (API Call Made)

```bash
# File + question
aixplosion "@Cargo.toml What is this project about?"
# Output: ✓ Added context file: Cargo.toml
#         [AI response about the project]

# Mixed content
aixplosion "@file1.txt Please explain this"
# Output: ✓ Added context file: file1.txt
#         [AI response explaining the file]
```

## Benefits

### 1. Token Savings
- **Before**: Every message, even context-only ones, made API calls
- **After**: Only messages with actual content make API calls
- **Savings**: 50-1000+ tokens saved per context-only message

### 2. Faster Workflow
- No waiting for AI responses when just loading context
- Immediate feedback on file loading success/failure
- Cleaner interactive sessions

### 3. Better User Experience
- Clear distinction between context loading and questioning
- No confusing empty responses from the AI
- More predictable behavior

## Interactive Mode Workflow

```bash
aixplosion
> @package.json
✓ Added context file: package.json

> @src/index.js  
✓ Added context file: src/index.js

> @README.md
✓ Added context file: README.md

> How does this application work?
[AI response using all three files as context]
```

## Testing

I've created comprehensive test files:

1. **`CONTEXT_ONLY_MODE.md`** - Detailed documentation and test cases
2. **`test_context_only.sh`** - Automated test script
3. **Updated `USER_GUIDE.md`** - Added context-only mode documentation

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible** - All existing functionality preserved:
- Normal messages with questions work exactly as before
- File loading with questions works exactly as before  
- All slash commands work unchanged
- All tool support works unchanged

## Implementation Details

### Detection Logic
The system uses a simple but effective approach:
1. Extract all `@file` references from the message
2. Load all referenced files into context
3. Remove `@file` syntax from the message
4. Check if any content remains after cleaning
5. If no content remains → return early (no API call)
6. If content remains → proceed with API call

### Error Handling
- Invalid files show error messages but don't prevent other files from loading
- Mixed valid/invalid files in context-only mode still don't make API calls
- All existing error handling preserved

### Logging
- Added info-level logging for context-only detection
- Preserved all existing logging behavior
- Clear distinction in logs between context-only and normal messages

This implementation provides exactly what you requested: the ability to add context files without triggering AI responses, enabling a more efficient workflow for building context before asking questions.
