# Logging Cleanup Complete

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Excessive API Request/Response Logging

**File: `src/anthropic.rs`**

- Removed raw API response printing to console
- Removed streaming response debug headers
- Kept debug-level logging (only visible when debug logging is enabled)

**Before:**
```rust
// Print raw server response to console for visibility
println!("{}", "=== RAW SERVER RESPONSE ===".bright_yellow().bold());
println!("{} {}", "Status:".bright_yellow(), status);
println!("{}", "Response:".bright_yellow());
println!("{}", response_text);
println!("{}", "==========================".bright_yellow().bold());
```

**After:**
```rust
// Log incoming response (debug level only)
debug!("Received API response with status: {}", status);
debug!("Response body: {}", response_text);
```

### 2. Removed Tool Call Console Logging

**File: `src/tools.rs`**

- Changed all tool call logging from `println!` to `debug!`
- Added `use log::debug;` import
- Tool calls are now only visible when debug logging is enabled

**Before:**
```rust
println!("ðŸ”§ TOOL CALL: list_directory('{}')", path);
```

**After:**
```rust
debug!("TOOL CALL: list_directory('{}')", path);
```

### 3. Affected Functions

All tool functions now use debug-level logging:
- `list_directory`
- `read_file`
- `write_file`
- `edit_file`
- `delete_file`
- `create_directory`
- `bash`

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Console Output**: No more raw API responses cluttering the user interface
2. **Better User Experience**: Users only see relevant information, not debug data
3. **Configurable Debugging**: Debug information still available when needed via `RUST_LOG=debug`
4. **Reduced Noise**: Tool calls no longer spam the console during normal operation

## How to Enable Debug Logging (if needed)

If you need to see the detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug ai-agent [your-arguments]
```

Or set environment variable:
```bash
export RUST_LOG=debug
ai-agent [your-arguments]
```

## Summary

The codebase now has a much cleaner user interface with excessive logging removed. All debug information is still available when needed through proper logging configuration, but normal operation is much cleaner and more user-friendly.
